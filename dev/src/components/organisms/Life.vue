    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="life__content">
      <p>I'd describe myself as a creative person who gets easily inspired by new things (and even simple things) and is excited about meeting new people. I always try to be patient with anything in my life and keep a positive attitude.</p>
      <p>When it comes to hobbies, music takes a special place in my life. I've been a vocalist in a band for several years, now do songwriting by myself and record music at home. I like to travel, but who doesn't? :) Top-3 things in this topic for me have always been: airplanes, discovering new tasty foods, and going to music festivals!</p>
      <p>I am also interested in yoga, cooking, and eco lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Currently I'm 26 y.o., originally from Kharkiv, Ukraine, now living in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland.</p>
